        <p>The Movie Database (https://www.themoviedb.org/) ("TMDB") respects the rights of copyright holders and publishers. We comply with U.S. copyright law and to respond to claims of copyright infringement. TMDB will promptly process and investigate notices of alleged infringement ("DMCA Notices") related to the TMDB website, mobile app, or other TMDB online service (the "The Movie DB") and will take appropriate actions under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, Title 17, United States Code, Section 512(c) ("DMCA").</p>

        <h2>1. DMCA Notices.</h2>
        <h3>A. DMCA Notices Generally.</h3>
        <p>If you believe that someone has posted content in which you own copyright in an unauthorized manner on The Movie DB, you can send us a DMCA Notice to request that the infringing content be removed. Before you submit a DMCA Notice, you must reasonably consider whether particular content does, in fact, infringe upon your copyright, or whether, for instance, "fair use" under 17 U.S.C. §107 applies. If you are unsure whether the content you intend to report is infringing your copyright, you may wish to seek legal guidance. Please keep in mind that submitting intentionally misleading reports of infringement may be punishable under the DMCA in the United States or similar laws in other countries, including under Section 512(f) of the DMCA, which provides that any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity is a copyright infringement may be subject to liability for damages.</p>

          <li>An identification of the material on The Movie DB that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of the infringing activity, and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, as well as information reasonably sufficient to permit TMDB to locate the material, including at a minimum, if applicable, the URL of the link shown on The Movie DB or the exact location where such material may be found.</li>

        <h2>3. Repeated Infringement.</h2>
        <p>We do not condone or tolerate copyright infringement or any violation of the intellectual property rights on The Movie DB. We reserve the right to terminate the access and/or use privileges of any person who has been determined to engage in repeat infringement of copyright on The Movie DB. We further reserve the right to define the criteria by which We will determine if a person is a repeat infringer subject to termination or disablement of access to The Movie DB. If it is determined that "repeat infringer" is defined by statute, law, or regulation as applicable to 17 USC § 512, TMDB will adopt that definition as a minimum standard. Without limiting TMDB's right to define "repeat infringer", as a general rule, TMDB will define a "repeat infringer" as any person or entity about whom TMDB has received three or more valid DMCA Notices. TMDB will take into account all relevant facts and circumstances when determining whether or not termination of access and/or use privileges of a "repeat infringer" is appropriate.</p>
        <p>REGARDLESS OF WHETHER TMDB TERMINATES ACCESS AND/OR USE PRIVILEGES OF ANY PERSON OR ENTITY, "REPEAT INFRINGER" OR OTHERWISE, TMDB IN NO WAY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO PURSUE ANY AVAILABLE REMEDY AT LAW OR IN EQUITY AGAINST COPYRIGHT INFRINGERS OR ANY OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS VIOLATORS, NOR WILL TMDB INDEMNIFY OR PROVIDE LEGAL REPRESENTATION TO ANY ALLEGED INFRINGER IN ANY ACTION ARISING FROM THE ALLEGED INFRINGER'S USE OF THE MOVIE DB.</p>
