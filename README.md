- **npm** (comes with Node.js)
- **TMDB API Key** (Required)

---

## 🔑 Getting a TMDB API Key

To use TMDB's API, you'll need a free API key.

👉 Follow the official guide here:  
[TMDB API Getting Started](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started)

Once you have your key, you’ll use it in the configuration step.

---

## 📦 Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

1. **Rename** the `.env.example` file to `.env`:
   ```bash
   mv .env.example .env
   ```

2. **Fill in your API key:**
   Open `.env` and set your TMDB API key:
   ```env
   REACT_APP_TMDB_API_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key_here
   ```

---

## 🎨 Customizing Styles and Pages

By default, styles are defined using CSS `:root` selectors in each style file. This approach was required in an earlier version, and although not ideal, it's currently necessary to manually update each one.

To update colors and themes:

1. **Edit every CSS file** and modify the `:root` variables.
2. **Also update colors** in:
   ```bash
   src/components/Others/SideButtons.jsx
   ```

---

## 🔞 Enabling Adult & NSFW Content

If you want to allow adult and NSFW movies or TV shows to be displayed:

1. Open the following file:
   ```bash
   src/services/tmdbService.jsx
   ```

2. Replace **all instances** of:
   ```js
   include_adult=false
   ```
   with:
   ```js
   include_adult=true
   ```

> ⚠️ **Note:** This enables the listing of adult content. However, **many embedded streaming players do not support NSFW content**, so availability for streaming is **not guaranteed**.

---

## 🧪 Run & Build

### Start the app in development mode:
```bash
npm run start
```

### Build the app for production:
```bash
npm run build
```

---

## 🌐 Publishing

After building the app:

1. Locate the generated `build/` folder.
2. Upload the contents of this folder to your hosting provider (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, Firebase, or your own server).

That's it — your site is live!
